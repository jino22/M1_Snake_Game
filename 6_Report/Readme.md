## Who:
 It was programmed by Taneli Armanto, a design engineer in Nokia. 
## Where:
The concept of Snake originated from the 1976 arcade game Blockade, developed by a British company called Gremlin Interactive, which shut down in 1984.

## What:
Snake is a classic game that requires players to assess their surroundings and find the quickest or safest route to a point. This is an excellent opportunity to learn about spatial awareness and plan ahead to your next move.
## When:
Snake first appeared on a Nokia device in 1997 on the Nokia 6110. It was adapted for Nokia devices by Taneli Armanto, a Design Engineer, User Interface Software. FIVE. Snake was one of three games introduced in 1997, the others were Logic and Memory.
## How:
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves.
